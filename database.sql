(1, 'What does Google know about you? Everything.\r\n\r\nSeriously -- everything. Especially if you frequently use Google''s many products, such as Android, Gmail, Drive, Google Maps, or YouTube. Or, you know, Google Search.\r\n\r\nBut there''s some good news, sort of. Google has introduced a new data dashboard called the My Activity page where you can see just about every single piece of data that Google has collected about you over the better part of the past two decades. Every website you''ve visited, every image you''ve viewed, every search term you''ve typed into the Google Search box.\r\n\r\nIt''s terrifying. But it''s also pretty useful, because, as evidenced by the mountain of data Google has stored on you, knowledge is power. From the My Activity page you not only see what Google is tracking, you can also take steps to delete data and prevent future collection.'),
(2, 'Tesla CEO Elon Musk has signaled that a new major project is in the works, but the electric-car maker isn''t quite ready for an unveiling.\r\n\r\nMusk tweeted Sunday that he''s "working on Top Secret Tesla Masterplan, Part 2. Hoping to publish later this week."\r\n\r\nIt wasn''t immediately clear what Musk might be working on. Follow-up tweets didn''t mention the masterplan, and Tesla representatives did not respond to a request for comment.\r\n\r\nMusk''s tweet is reminiscent of a 2006 blog post titled "The Secret Tesla Motors Master Plan (just between you and me)," in which Musk described his company''s production goals and hinted at the cars that became the Tesla Model S four-door family car and the Tesla 3 sports sedan.\r\n\r\nMusk has been under pressure for the past couple of weeks since it was revealed that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is looking into the design and performance of the Autopilot system on the Tesla Model S after announcing the death of a driver in which Autopilot was engaged. The Palo Alto, California, company, also announced that the number of vehicles it delivered to customers in the second quarter fell well short of its own expectations.'),
(3, 'Many people spent the weekend getting acquainted with augmented reality, the fusing of the digital and physical world, through the popular new Pokemon Go app that lets users see fictitious creatures hanging out in the real world through a phone screen.\r\n\r\nBut augmented reality, also referred to as mixed reality, can have more practical applications like training.\r\n\r\nThat''s exactly what Microsoft was pushing for at its Worldwide Partner Conference on Monday. Presenters at the Toronto event used Microsoft''s heavily hyped HoloLens to bring a digital representation of a jet engine on stage to show how Japan Airlines intends to use the technology to train flight crews and mechanics.\r\n\r\n"We can continue to learn in new ways, not possible in the real world," said Lorraine Bardeen, general manager of Windows and HoloLens experiences production and strategy for Microsoft.'),
(4, 'Twitter is adding presidential politics to its live-streaming repertoire.\r\n\r\nThe social network, known in part for its users'' bite-size, and often biting, commentary in real time, will be joining forces with CBS News to live-stream CBSN''s coverage of the Republican and Democratic national conventions, the first of which kicks off next week. (Disclosure: CBS is the parent company of CNET.)\r\n\r\nIt''s yet another step in Twitter''s shift toward live-streamed video, a format that has also been embraced by rival Facebook. Later this year, for instance, Twitter will stream the NFL''s Thursday night football games, and the company is reportedly in negotiations to get the digital streaming rights for the NBA and Major League Soccer.'),
(5, 'When Greg Greeley and his team flipped the switch on the first-ever Prime Day last year, starting in Japan, they quickly realized their idea to host a major sales event in July would pay off.\r\n\r\n"We knew immediately when we turned on Japan and saw the response from Japanese Prime members that we had hit upon something special," Greeley, the vice president of Amazon Prime worldwide, said in an interview Friday.\r\n\r\nHeading into the second annual Prime Day this Tuesday, the stakes are higher, as Amazon hopes to make this year''s sale even bigger. Greeley spoke with CNET about what consumers can expect from the upcoming event, which is exclusive to its Prime members, and how Amazon made changes in response to consumer criticisms last year. He also offered some insights on what''s to come from Prime.'),
(6, 'Pokemon Go has become a phenomenon -- at least, in the select countries where it''s available. China is among the many nations without the new AR iOS and Android game, and people there have been tiding themselves over with the next best thing (apparently): City Elf Go.\r\n\r\nThe similarities between the two games isn''t limited to just their names. City Elf Go also uses geo-location to let you find, catch and battle creatures. Unlike Pokemon Go, it doesn''t use a smartphone''s camera to create an augmented reality.\r\n\r\nCreated by a developer who goes by Xiaoyu Sun, the game is currently the most popular app in Apple''s iOS store in China. It''s likely doing very well on Android as well, but there''s no way to track it, thanks to the Google Play store not being available in China.'),
(7, 'A team of researchers in Japan has created a system of robotic motion that can move a humanoid skeleton. This system, designed by a team at the Suzumori Endo Lab at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, allows robots with the same geometry as a human, and could result in more realistic humanoid robots.\r\n\r\nThe system actually uses bundles of many small fibre tubes. These are actuated pneumatically, that is, air or gas is pumped through them to tauten and slacken the "muscles" and allow the skeleton to which they are attached walk, bite and perform other movements. The problem, of course, is that it needs to be tethered to the air pressure source to do so. The project is ongoing, which is great, because we didn''t know how badly the world needed friendly robotic skeletons until we saw this video.'),
(8, 'A new dwarf planet has joined the solar system''s ranks. Discovered by an international team of astronomers, the planet, named 2015 RR245 for now, is apparently just 700 kilometres in diameter, although more accurate measurements will need to be taken to gauge its exact size. And it''s really far away, roughly 120 times Earth''s distance from the sun, with a single orbit taking 700 years.\r\n\r\nFor comparison, Pluto has a diameter of 2,374 kilometres, and completes an orbit of the sun every 248 years.\r\n\r\n"Finding a new dwarf planet beyond Neptune sheds light on the early phases of planet formation," said Brett Gladman of the University of British Columbia. "Since most of these icy worlds are incredibly small and faint, it''s exciting to find a bright one that is easier to study, and which is on an interesting orbit."\r\n\r\nRR245 is the first dwarf planet discovered as part of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey, and is one of potentially over 100 dwarf planets in the solar system. The next step will be refining its orbit, after which it will be given an official name.');
